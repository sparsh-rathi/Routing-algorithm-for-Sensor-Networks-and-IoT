You have a set of nodes (computing devices). You need to select a certain set of gateway nodes from among the set of nodes that will be responsible for collecting data from other nodes and sending them over the network. The idea is to find the right amount of gateway nodes to be selected (number, location in a cluster, health of the node - in terms of connectivity and energy, etc.) such that the set of nodes in a cluster remain in operation for a longer period of time when compared to a situation when there is only one gateway node in the cluster. We will not be working with actual nodes and networks but will simulate the nodes and network on MATLAB / GNU Octave.
The repository is for the Semester 7 Project on Routing algorithm for Sensor Networks and IoT
